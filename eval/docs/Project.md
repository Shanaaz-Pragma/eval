# Project: Online Note-Taking Application

## Objective: 

Build a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes 
using IndexedDB for client-side storage, 
web workers for background processing, 
web components for building custom elements, 
and async code for handling asynchronous operations.

## Requirements:

The application should have a clean and responsive user interface built with HTML and CSS.
The user should be able to create a new note by entering a title and text, and then clicking a button or hitting the "Enter" key.
The user should be able to view a list of all notes, and click on a note to view its details.
The user should be able to edit an existing note by clicking an "Edit" button, making changes, and then clicking a "Save" button or hitting the "Enter" key.
The user should be able to delete a note by clicking a "Delete" button.
All data should be stored in IndexedDB, and web workers should be used to handle any time-consuming operations such as loading or saving data.
The application should use web components to build custom elements for the note list, and note editor.
All code should be written in JavaScript, with appropriate use of async/await and Promises to handle asynchronous operations.

The application must be memory efficient and performant.
The application must support potentially large lists.
All accessibility markers should be in place.

Timeframe: 3 to 4 hours.

## Patterns:

You should use the following patterns in your code.

1. convention over code
2. factory pattern

## Structure

The following will affect your score.
Your application and file structure
Naming of everything from files to classes and members
Loading resources, when you load it and how you load it

## Prohibited:

1. Frameworks

## Time

The project starts at 12:00 and ends at 16:00.
Finaly commits must be done no later than 16:00.
Where you are at that time is where you are.
Making changes after the time will reduce the score.

## Score

We will work on a percentage bases.
This will be based on.

1. Completeness of the project
2. If you finished it on time
3. The correctness of the code
4. What patterns you implimented

Gerhard and I will be evaluating the projects.
Passing score is 90%.

## Bonus features

If you have time left, please look at implementing any of the following.

1. Search and Filtering: Allow the user to search and filter the notes by title or text. This could be implemented using web workers to perform the search and filtering in the background.
1. Offline Support: Allow the application to work offline by using a service worker to cache the application's resources and the user's notes. This would test the developer's understanding of service workers and offline web applications.

## Conclusion

Please do your best and make sure you have your project checked into your personal github by 16:00.
Send the link to myself for review.
Reviews will be done over the course of the next week after it has been done.
Personal feedback will also be given too you as part of the final review.
You will also be asked to explain your code so cheaters will be caught out.

Bonus features will count to additional points so you can have more than 100%.
Those who score above 100% will get a prise.

In the end the purpose of this excersize is to evaluate how compitent our team is and what we need to focus on for the next year around training.
Also keep in mind that this is the bare basics.
This is the absolute minimum requirements of what you need to be capable of.
